Machine learning isn't really too difficult if you break it down into steps
"Buzzword"
Machine learning is mainly supervised (guiding the machine how to approach the task)
Unsupervised machine learning is what people think machine learning is
Machine classification is a better term (automated classification)
A form of supervised ml is called ml, but all ml is classfied
(ie unsupervised clustering-throw data at machine and look for groups/classfications)
supervised - guide the machine, label the data, we know the answers, show it
unsupervised - dont guide the machine, let it go on its own
human classfication is one of our preferences, but from a scientific standpoint, not everything is so binary
machines are better at looking at gradients/probabilities (better for science)
dont make your own supervised ml, its already done very well
most time with ml is spent getting data, organizing data, and structuring data for algorithm (at least normalization)
(ie derive values from fundamental data)
machine learning cannot be applied to everything (only unsupervised learning can do that)
	very difficult
fear ml? nah we gucci
